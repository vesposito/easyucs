# EasyUCS

EasyUCS is a toolbox to help deploy and manage Cisco UCS devices.

It can :

* [deploy a configuration](docs/CONFIG.md) on a running UCS device:
    - UCS system (UCS Manager)
    - UCS IMC (Integrated Management Controller) for standalone servers
    - UCS Central
* perform the initial setup of an "out of the box" UCS device (UCSM or CIMC)
* reset the configuration of an UCS device before configuring it
* fetch a configuration and export it in JSON format
* [fetch an inventory](docs/INVENTORY.md) and export it in JSON format
* create pictures of equipment and infrastructure [schemas](docs/SCHEMAS.md)
* create [Technical Architecture Documentation (TAD)](docs/REPORT.md) in Word format

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Minimum versions of UCS devices :

* UCS Manager: ***3.2(1d)*** or above
* UCS IMC: ***3.0(1c)*** or above
* UCS Central: ***2.0(1a)*** or above

This tool requires ***Python 3.x*** to work. *Python 2.x* is not supported.

Python can be used on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS X and more.

You can download the latest version of *Python 3* on the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing
EasyUCS can either be installed locally to a directory or using a Python
package management tool like `pip`. Outside of testing and development, `pip`
is the preferred method.

#### Using Pip
Pip can be install the current version directly from a link to the GitHub repository, like
- with Linux or Mac OSX
```
pip install https://github.com/vesposito/easyucs.git
```
- with Windows
```
python -m pip install https://github.com/vesposito/easyucs.git
```

It can also be used to install from a locally downloaded copy of the package. Instructions for downloading manually are in the next section.
- with Linux or Mac OSX
```
pip install path/to/local/copy
```

- with Windows
```
python -m pip install path/to/local/copy
```

#### Downloading Manually

##### From GitHub
Click *"Clone or Download"* and *"Download ZIP"* on the GitHub website to download the whole project.

Uncompress the zip and put the folder on your system. Commands under *Running
EasyUCS* below can be run from the root of the uncompressed folder.

##### From Git command line
You need to have Git on your system (not necessarily installed by default on all types of system).

Navigate to your desired path where you want EasyUCS to be placed on and clone it through your command-line console,

```
git clone https://github.com/vesposito/easyucs.git
```

## Requirements

EasyUCS requires some Python modules dependencies. The file **[setup.py](./setup.py)** contains these requirements.

**If you installed EasyUCS using Pip, this step is already complete.** Otherwise, you will need to install the dependencies either by hand, using Pip manually, or with your operating system package manager.

## Running EasyUCS

EasyUCS can be used with command line interface or via a Web GUI.

**If you installed EasyUCS into a local directory, substitue `easyucs/scripts/easyucs` or `easyucs/scripts/easyucs_gui` for `easyucs` or `easyucs_gui` respectively.**


### Using the Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Push config file `config_ucsm.json` to UCS system
```
easyucs config push -t ucsm -i 192.168.0.1 -u admin -p password -f configs/config_ucsm.json
```

Reset UCS IMC and push config file `config_cimc.json`
```
easyucs config push -t cimc -i 192.168.0.2 -u admin -p password -f configs/config_cimc.json -r
```

Reset UCS system, perform initial setup using DHCP IP addresses `192.168.0.11` & `192.168.0.12` and push config file `config_ucsm.json`
```
easyucs config push -t ucsm -f configs/config_ucsm.json -r -s 192.168.0.11 192.168.0.12
```

Fetch config from UCS system and save it to `output/configs/config_ucsm.json`
```
easyucs config fetch -t ucsm -i 192.168.0.1 -u admin -p password -o output/configs/config_ucsm.json
```


Fetch inventory from UCS IMC and save it to `output/inventories/inventory_cimc.json`
```
easyucs inventory fetch -t cimc -i 192.168.0.2 -u admin -p password -o output/inventories/inventory_cimc.json
```

Create schemas from UCS system and save them to `output/schemas` folder
```
easyucs schemas create -t ucsm -i 192.168.0.1 -u admin -p password -o output/schemas
```

Create report from UCS system and save it to `output/reports` folder
```
easyucs report generate -t ucsm -i 192.168.0.1 -u admin -p password -o output/reports
```

#### Using the Web Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The Web GUI is hosted by your machine, in order to launch it you need to use the **[easyucs_gui module](./easyucs/easyucs_gui.py)**.

```
easyucs_gui
```


## Built With
