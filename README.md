# EasyUCS [![published](https://static.production.devnetcloud.com/codeexchange/assets/images/devnet-published.svg)](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/vesposito/easyucs)

EasyUCS is a toolbox to help deploy and manage Cisco UCS/Intersight devices.

It can :

* [deploy a configuration](docs/CONFIG.md) on a running UCS device / Intersight instance:
    - UCS system (UCS Manager)
    - UCS IMC (Integrated Management Controller) for standalone servers
    - UCS Central
    - Intersight (SaaS or Appliance)
    - IMM Domain (Fabric Interconnects running in Intersight mode)
* perform the initial setup of an "out of the box" UCS device (UCSM, IMM or CIMC)
* reset the configuration of a UCS device before configuring it
* [fetch a configuration](docs/CONFIG.md) and export it in JSON format
* [fetch an inventory](docs/INVENTORY.md) and export it in JSON format
* [perform maintenance actions](docs/ACTIONS.md) on a UCS device (regenerate self-signed certificate, clear user sessions, clear SEL logs)
* claim/unclaim UCS devices to/from Intersight
* create pictures of equipment and infrastructure [schemas](docs/SCHEMAS.md)
* create [Technical Architecture Documentation (TAD)](docs/REPORT.md) in Word/PDF formats

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Minimum versions of UCS devices :

* UCS Manager: ***3.2(1d)*** or above
* UCS IMC: ***3.0(1c)*** or above
* UCS Central: ***2.0(1a)*** or above
* Intersight SaaS ***(no prerequisite)*** & Appliance: ***1.1.1-0*** or above

This tool requires ***Python 3.8+*** to work. *Python 2.x* is not supported.

Python can be used on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS X and more.

You can download the latest version of *Python 3* on the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing
EasyUCS can be installed using any of ways below:

#### From GitHub
Click *"Clone or Download"* and *"Download ZIP"* on the GitHub website to download the whole project. 

Uncompress the zip and put the folder on your system. 

#### From Git command line

You need to have Git on your system (not necessarily installed by default on all types of system).

Navigate to your desired path where you want EasyUCS to be placed on and clone it through your command-line console,

```
git clone https://github.com/vesposito/easyucs.git
```

## Requirements

EasyUCS requires some Python modules dependencies. The file **[requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)** contains all of these requirements.

Use Python Pip to install all of them.

- for Max OS X, Unix, Linux:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- for Windows:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running EasyUCS

EasyUCS can be used with command line interface or via a Web GUI.


### Using the Web Graphical User Interface (GUI) / the API
