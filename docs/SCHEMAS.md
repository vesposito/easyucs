# Infrastructure & equipment schemas creation

EasyUCS can generate infrastructure & equipment schemas from a live device.

The following schemas are generated:
* Front & rear view of chassis including i/o modules and blades
* Front & rear view of rack servers including adapters
* Front & rear view of fabric interconnects & fabric extenders
* Infrastructure view of each chassis & rack server with its physical connectivity to the fabric interconnects
* Infrastructure view of LAN neighbors connected to the fabric interconnects
* Infrastructure view of SAN neighbors connected to the fabric interconnects
* Service Profile deployment view


## Schemas creation

### Using the Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The **[easyucs module](../easyucs.py)** is the main module that you will use.
You can find help at each step by entering the **"-h"** argument.

It first needs the type of scope of action you want to use as an argument.
The scope of action:
```
Scope:
  Scope of action

  {config,inventory,schemas,report}
                        EasyUCS scope
    config              config-related actions
    inventory           inventory-related actions
    schemas             schemas-related actions
    report              report-related actions
```

The second argument is the type of action:
```
Action:
  {create}    Schemas actions
    create    Create schemas of an UCS device
```
